# 🌐 Container Networking Project: From Scratch to Swarm 🚀

Ever wondered how container networks *really* work? This repository unravels the magic! ✨

We build a complete microservices infrastructure, starting from **raw Linux primitives** (namespaces, bridges, iptables) and evolving all the way to a **multi-host Docker Swarm cluster**.

---

### Quick Start & Deep Dive:

➡️ **Get Started Here:** For a full step-by-step guide, check out the [Implementation Guide](ass7/Implementation_Guide.md).

🏗️ **Understand the Design:** Dive into the [Architecture Document](ass7/Architecture_Document.md) for a system overview.

💡 **See What Changed:** Each `ass<N>/changes.md` file highlights the evolution and justifications for design decisions.

---

### Project Goal:

To demystify container networking by showing you the *why* (Linux primitives) and the *how* (Docker Swarm) of modern distributed systems.

**Happy Networking!** 🔗

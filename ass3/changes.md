# Assignment 3: Changes & Justifications

This document details the key changes made during the implementation of Assignment 3 compared to the original plan in `week-long-project.md`. The main evolution was to consolidate four separate monitoring scripts into a single, intelligent toolkit.

### Summary of Key Changes

| Feature                 | Original Plan                                | Actual Implementation (`assignment3.sh`)                                                                                                                                                              | Justification & Error Avoided                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Script Organization** | Four separate, disconnected scripts.         | A single, unified toolkit (`assignment3.sh`) that accepts the desired tool (`traffic`, `health`, etc.) as a command-line argument.                                                                    | **Justification:** This approach is much cleaner and more user-friendly. It provides a single, memorable entry point for all monitoring tasks, creating a cohesive "monitoring dashboard" experience instead of forcing the user to remember and manage four different script names.                                                 |
| **Dependency Management** | Manual installation of all prerequisites.    | **Automatic, on-demand prerequisite installation.** The script checks for required packages for the *specific tool being run* (e.g., it only installs `tcpdump` if you run the `traffic` tool) and installs them automatically using `apt-get` and `pip`. | **Error Avoided:** This prevents the scripts from failing with `command not found` errors. It's more efficient than installing all prerequisites at once and ensures the user has exactly what they need to run a specific tool without any manual setup.                                                               |
| **Code Structure**      | Static script files that the user must create. | The core logic is in the main shell script. The Python-based tools (`health`, `topology`) are **dynamically generated as temporary files** at runtime, and automatically cleaned up afterwards.        | **Justification:** This makes the entire toolkit self-contained in a single, portable file (`assignment3.sh`). The user doesn't need to manage multiple Python and shell script files; they only need the main toolkit script, which simplifies distribution and reduces clutter.                                                  |
| **Robustness & Error Handling** | Minimal error checking; scripts assumed a perfect environment. | The tools are more robust and include checks for common failure conditions. For example, the `connection-tracker` and `topology-visualizer` first verify that the network namespaces exist before attempting to inspect them. | **Error Avoided:** The original scripts would have failed with cryptic errors if, for example, the network from Assignment 1 wasn't running. The implemented checks provide clear feedback (e.g., "namespace not found") instead of crashing, making the tools more reliable and easier to troubleshoot. |

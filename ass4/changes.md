# Assignment 4: Changes & Justifications

This document details the key changes made during the implementation of Assignment 4. This assignment marked a major architectural evolution, splitting into two distinct paths:
1.  **Part A:** Enhancing the original flat network with a service registry and security policies.
2.  **Part B:** Building a completely new, advanced architecture with network segmentation and load balancing.

## Part A: Changes to the Flat Network

### Summary of Key Changes (Service Registry & Security)

| Feature                 | Original Plan                                                                          | Actual Implementation (`assignment4.sh`)                                                                                                                                                             | Justification & Error Avoided                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tooling**             | Separate, manual scripts for service registry and security.                            | A single, unified toolkit (`assignment4.sh`) with clear subcommands (`start-registry`, `apply-policies`, etc.).                                                                                          | **Justification:** This provides a much cleaner, more manageable, and professional interface for advanced network functions, centralizing control in one place.                                                                                                    |
| **Security Policy**     | A list of `ACCEPT` rules without a default `DROP`.                                     | A more secure implementation that first sets the default `FORWARD` policy to `DROP` and explicitly allows `ESTABLISHED,RELATED` traffic.                                                              | **Error Avoided:** The original plan was insecure. It would have allowed any traffic not explicitly matching a rule, defeating the purpose of a firewall. The implemented "default deny" strategy is a fundamental security best practice. The lack of a `conntrack` rule for established connections would have broken all two-way communication (like HTTP responses). |
| **Dependency Management** | Manual installation of `Flask` was assumed.                                            | The script integrates with the shared Python virtual environment created in Assignment 2, ensuring dependencies are managed correctly and automatically.                                                  | **Justification:** This avoids polluting the global Python environment and ensures that the correct library versions are used, making the setup more robust and reproducible.                                                                               |

## Part B: The New Segmented & Load-Balanced Architecture

The most significant change was the introduction of a new, advanced architecture in the `modified_setup/` directory. This was a deliberate move away from patching the simple flat network to building a more realistic, secure, and scalable system from the ground up.

### Justification for the New Architecture

The original flat network had significant limitations that would be difficult to overcome. The decision to build a new, segmented architecture was driven by the need to implement professional-grade features correctly.

| Feature                   | Original Flat Network Limitation                                                                    | New Segmented Architecture Solution                                                                                                     | Justification & Benefit                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Security & Isolation**  | All services were on the same bridge (`br0`), meaning a compromise of one service could easily spread to others. Security was entirely dependent on complex `iptables` rules. | **Network Segmentation**. Three separate bridges (`br-frontend`, `br-backend`, `br-database`) isolate the application tiers. The database is on a completely separate network from the frontend. | **Benefit:** This is "defense in depth." An attacker who compromises the web-facing Nginx container cannot directly attack the PostgreSQL database because they are not on the same network. Security is enforced by the topology itself, which is far more robust. |
| **Scalability**           | Ran only a single instance of each service. Scaling would require complex manual work.                | **Native Load Balancing**. The architecture was designed to run multiple replicas of the `product-service` from the start, with a new `api-gateway-lb.py` that automatically distributes traffic among them. | **Benefit:** This is the foundation of a scalable system. It allows the application to handle increased traffic by simply adding more service replicas, a core concept of microservices.                                      |
| **Automation**            | The original plan implied manual, error-prone changes to the network to add new bridges and services. | **Fully Automated Deployment**. The new `assignment4-network.sh` and `assignment4-services.sh` scripts can create and destroy the entire advanced environment with just two commands. | **Benefit:** This infrastructure-as-code approach is essential for modern operations. It guarantees a consistent, repeatable, and reliable deployment, which would be nearly impossible to achieve manually with this level of complexity. |
| **Organization**          | All services were mixed together in a single IP range.                                                | **Tiered Architecture**. Services are organized into logical tiers (frontend, backend, data) with their own subnets. This is a standard and well-understood pattern. | **Benefit:** This improves maintainability and makes the system easier to reason about. It also contains the "blast radius" of failures; a problem in one tier is less likely to cascade and affect another.       |
